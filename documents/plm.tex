\begin{abstract}
The precision of \Kepler\ photometry%
  ---the most precise photometric measurements of stars ever made---%
  appears to be limited by unknown or untracked variations
  in spacecraft pointing, point-spread function, stellar motions and parallaxes, and temperature.
Here we present \name,
  a data-driven model of these variations in \Kepler\ data (or really of their impact on the photometry).
Importantly (and uniquely),
  \name\ works at the pixel level (not the photometric measurement level);
  it can capture more fine-grained information about the variation of the spacecraft
  (especially regarding pointing and point-spread function)
  than is available in the pixel-summed photometry.
\name\ is extreme in that it has enormous flexibility and it only uses data (and meta-data) to model data:
\name\ provides a prediction for each readout pixel built from a linear combination of the readouts
  from very large numbers of nearby pixels (plus some spacecraft information);
  the choice of nearby pixels is guided by ideas from causal inference.
\name\ avoids over-fitting by employing a train-and-test formalism
  designed to ensure that transit-like photometric events and short-timescale stellar variability
  cannot be captured or distorted by the model;
  it is designed to remove spacecraft-induced variability but not intrinsic stellar variability.
We show that \name\ outperforms the \Kepler\ Presearch (\sic) Data Conditioning method on a set of example stars.
We release open-source code that provides \name\ output for any star in the existing \Kepler\ Archive,
  and we discuss applications for other missions,
  including any possible \Kepler\ two-wheel mission.
\end{abstract}

The photometric measurements of stars made by the \Kepler\ Satellite are precise enough
  to permit discovery of exoplanet transits with depths smaller than $10^{-4}$.
This precision results from great spacecraft stability,
  supplemented by various methods for removing small residual spacecraft-induced and stellar-variability trends in the brightnesses,
  either filtering the data (with things like median filters; CITE)
  or fitting the data with flexible models (like polynomials or splines or Gaussian Processes; CITE).
When employed in the service of exoplanet search and characterization,
  these methods are usually agnostic about whether photometric variations originate in the spacecraft or in the star itself;
  that is, they obliterate intrinsic stellar variability along with spacecraft issues.

Reminder:  \Kepler\ performs photometry very naively...

One method that is designed to model spacecraft-induced problems
  but \emph{not} interfere with measurements of stellar variability
  is the \Kepler\ Presearch (\sic) Data Conditioning (PDC) method (CITE).
The PDC ``de-trends'' the \Kepler\ lightcurves by fitting them with a small set of basis lightcurves
  generated from a principal components analysis (PCA) of filtered lightcurves.
That is, it uses data to model data,
  regularizing the fit (and avoiding over-fitting) by filtering and restricting the dimensionality (through PCA).
The method proposed here, \name, is similar in spirit to the PDC.
The main differences are
  (1)~that it works in the pixel domain, not the lightcurve domain, so it has access to more fine-grained information,
  (2)~that it has far more freedom (far more parameters)
  but it strictly avoids over-fitting the lightcurves on exoplanet-transit time-scales
  through strong regularization and a train-and-test framework, and
  (3)~that when it fits a star, there is no possibility of any contribution of the star itself to the fit basis vectors.
The two methods are similar however,
  in that they both make the assumption that whatever spacecraft effects are imprinting variability on a stellar lightcurve
  must also be imprinting similar or related variability on other lightcurves.
By going to the pixel level, \name\ makes it easier for the model to capture variability
  that is coming through variations in the point-spread function
  or spacecraft roll or pointing.
